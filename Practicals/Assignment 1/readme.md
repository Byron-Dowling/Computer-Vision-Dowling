## Color Tracking
This task was to track different colored objects using a variety of color spaces: BGR, HSV, and LAB, and display them with bounding boxes. The primary goal was to identify the different colored M&M's that we tested on. However the results also work for some other similar-colored objects as you see in the picture below.
