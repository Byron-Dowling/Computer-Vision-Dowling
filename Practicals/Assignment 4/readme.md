## Assignment Details

### Support Vector Machines
 - Test different configurations of an SVM and test its performance with object detection
     - Different configs include linear and polynomial kernels as well as different CNN codes
     - Through extensive testing, the linear kernel appeared to be the most optimal performer

 ### Multilayer Perceptron
  - Load the same caltech dataset and build a MLP and experiment with different layers to get the performance up
  - THe most optimal solution I found involved different subsequent layers of Dense layers followed by about 0.25% dropout
