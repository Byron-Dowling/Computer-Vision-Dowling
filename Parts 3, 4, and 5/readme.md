# Report

## Project Overview
  - For my project, we are wanting to train a model to spot the difference between a situation on the road that a human driver would consider to be dangerous.
  - Essentially, any situation that a driver would either proceed with caution or be ready to brake at a moment's notice because of sudden changing variables
  - Examples that have been annotated include:
          - Railroad crossings
          - Pedestrians walking in the middle of the road
          - Pedestrians in the crosswalk when it "is not their turn to walk"
          - Construction areas
          - Open doors and or cars blocking the roadway
          - Delivery vehicles in the process of loading/unloading
